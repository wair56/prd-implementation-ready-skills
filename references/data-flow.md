# Data Flow and Linkage Map

Solves: source, authority, transformation, writeback, linkage, side effect, and controlled resource/value closure.
Read when: a field, status, statistic, resource, payment callback, notification, report, or downstream object depends on data moving across objects/systems.
Pair with: `coverage-matrix.md`, `business-consistency.md`, `page-ui.md`, and finance topic files when money is involved.

Use this after the main business flow is roughly understood, and again before final PRD output. The goal is to ensure a PRD explains how data moves and what each action links to, not only what pages and statuses exist.

## Four Flows

For complex requirements, separate four flows:

| Flow | Purpose | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Business flow | What users/systems do to complete the business outcome | Main process and branches |
| Object flow | How each business object is created, changes, and ends | Object lifecycle / state machine |
| Data flow | Where data comes from, how it is transformed, persisted, consumed, and written back | Data flow map |
| Linkage flow | What else changes when one action happens | Linkage / side-effect map |

Do not treat these as the same thing. A single business action may update multiple objects, create messages, change visibility, lock source data, update statistics, and trigger external sync.

## Data Flow Map

Use this table when data source, transformation, or downstream consumption is unclear:

| Data Item | Trigger / Step | Visible Source Mark | Source / Authority | Input Conditions | Transform / Rule | Validation | Persisted Object / Field | Consumer | Writeback / Sync | Timing | Failure Handling | Reality / Consistency Check | Confirm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Check:

- Source: manual input, selected records, imported file, synced system, API callback, generated rule, configuration, historical snapshot.
- Authority: which source wins when copied data differs from source data.
- Transform: aggregation, split, mapping, rounding, dedupe, status conversion, field derivation.
- Timing: real-time, scheduled sync, manual refresh, after audit, after payment, after callback, T+N.
- Consumer: list, detail, downstream object, report/statistic, notification, permission, external system.
- Writeback: whether status, amount, lock, result, timestamp, or error reason is returned to upstream objects.
- Reality / consistency: whether the named source exists in the flow, contains the data used, uses the same authority in every module, and has a defined update/snapshot rule.

If a data item is displayed or used but has no source/authority/consumer, mark it as "数据流待确认".

## Resource / Value Flow Gate

Alias: Resource/Value Flow Gate.

Use this for any money or non-finance resource: inventory, coupon, quota, points, capacity, task slots, asset usage, content permission, membership rights, API usage, visibility, approval authority. A resource/value flow is data flow plus business conservation: the system must show where the resource comes from, when it is reserved, how it is allocated, when it is consumed, and how it is released.

| Resource / Value | Source | Authoritative Anchor | Owner / Pool | Trace Source | Eligibility | Reserve / Occupy Trigger | Allocate / Combine Rule | Partial Insufficiency Rule | Consume / Settle Trigger | Release / Reverse Rule | Role Perspective / Counterparty Visibility | Confirm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Rules:

- Do not invent an authoritative anchor. Pick the field/event that makes the resource belong to the business object, not the easiest timestamp in the system.
- Pool and trace are different. The pool controls current availability; trace explains where it came from. Do not require one-to-one pairing unless business rules need source-level locking.
- If users can combine multiple pools/sources, specify priority, split, ledger/status effect, and disabled reason when the combined amount/capacity/permission is still insufficient.
- Reserve and release are not finance-only. Inventory can be reserved, appointment slots can be held, coupons can be locked, quotas can be occupied, permissions can be granted/revoked.
- Role perspective matters: actor, owner, counterparty, approver, platform/admin, and tenant may see different totals, traces, disabled reasons, and history.

## Aggregation and Dimension Preservation Gate

Do not let a single total destroy useful business dimensions. A downstream step may use summary calculation while reports, audit, diagnosis, or profit analysis still need dimension analysis.

Use this when a PRD says "single total", "按总额", "不按车/不按明细", "汇总后传导", or when a detail dimension is removed.

| Decision | Must Define |
|---|---|
| Summary calculation | Which downstream object uses the single total and why it does not need detail allocation |
| Preserved dimensions | Which detail dimensions remain stored: vehicle dimension, customer/shipper, supplier, contract, route, project, tenant, period, cost type |
| Analysis use | Which pages/reports still support dimension analysis such as single-vehicle profit, customer profitability, supplier cost, exception diagnosis |
| Attribution rule | When a detail can map to a customer/vehicle/contract, whether it should be linked for analysis even if settlement uses total |
| Non-allocation boundary | Which downstream calculations explicitly do not allocate by detail, and what tradeoff that creates |
| Drilldown | How users jump from total to details and reconcile totals with detail sums |
| Historical change | Whether later mapping corrections rebuild only analysis dimensions or also downstream financial results |

Example: profit sharing may use a bill's single total for settlement, but the system can still keep vehicle dimension and customer mapping for single-vehicle profit analysis. Do not delete the detail dimension just because the settlement formula uses the total.

## Business Action Input vs Analysis Metric Gate

Use this when a PRD discussion asks for an amount, attribution, share, score, occupancy, cost attribution, usage split, or contribution metric and it is unclear whether that value is a settlement hard constraint or only an analysis metric.

First ask: **which business action consumes this metric?** The answer decides the required precision and timing.

| Question | Must Define |
|---|---|
| Business action consumer | What business action consumes the metric: invoice, settlement, payment, refund, allocation, approval, eligibility, quota release, recommendation, risk analysis, report, or dashboard |
| Hard action input | Whether the metric blocks or changes a money/resource action; if yes, it needs a reliable source, formula, snapshot, timing, and reverse behavior |
| Analysis-only use | Whether the metric is only for post-event risk analysis, operations review, profitability view, health score, or diagnosis |
| Source reality | Whether source data can actually compute it now, such as usage, mileage, duration, order count, vehicle/customer mapping, event logs, or manual tags |
| Non-allocation boundary | If no reliable allocation source exists, state that the metric cannot be a settlement prerequisite and must not become a hard gate |
| Dimension preservation | Which dimensions should still be stored for later analysis even when the business action uses a total |
| Financial/resource impact | Whether later mapping corrections only rebuild analysis outputs or also change financial results; if analysis-only, preserve dimensions but it does not change financial results |

Do not force a real-time allocation formula just because a business user asks "which customer/project/order used how much." If the current settlement, billing, payment, refund, or release flow does not consume that allocation, keep the financial action on its reliable inputs and write the attribution as an analysis metric.

Example: monthly settlement may use a total cost pool and confirmed customer receivable amounts, while customer-level cost attribution is only post-event risk analysis. If the system has no mileage/time/waybill effort source that allocates vehicle cost to each customer, the customer cost attribution cannot be a settlement prerequisite. Preserve dimensions such as vehicle, customer, waybill, route, project, and period for analysis, but do not change financial results or block settlement.

## Source Detail Eligibility Gate

Use this before any PRD says users or the system can select source details to generate a bill, reconciliation record, settlement record, payment request, invoice, profit-sharing record, or recovery batch. "Selectable source details" are not just list filters; they are financial input boundaries.

Define:

| Item | Must Define |
|---|---|
| Source detail object | order, waybill, cost item, income item, consumption item, bill line, payment line |
| Ownership scope | customer, supplier, contractor, project, route, organization, tenant, contract |
| Required business state | completed, signed, fee-confirmed, audited, payable, receivable, exception-free, not cancelled, not voided |
| Amount/source readiness | amount exists, formula source is available, currency/tax/rounding are defined, abnormal amount behavior is clear |
| Period eligibility | which attribution anchor and period boundary place the detail in the selectable window |
| Existing occupation | whether already selected by draft/pending/confirmed/paid/profit-shared records blocks reuse |
| Occupation timing | when selection creates occupation: draft save, submit, audit approval, payment, or receipt |
| Release rule | which reverse actions release occupation and which terminal states keep it occupied |
| Unavailable reason | how unavailable details are hidden or shown with a reason |
| Snapshot rule | whether generated records freeze source fields or follow later source/master-data changes |

If eligibility or occupation is undefined, do not write final wording like "select waybills" or "select orders". Mark it as source detail eligibility pending and ask the smallest question needed.

## Internal Generated Data

Treat internal data as sourced data, not as magic. For every system-generated record, status, statistic, snapshot, message, task, jump parameter, or derived amount, define:

| Generated Data | Trigger | Input Data | Generation Rule / Version | Persisted Object | Authority After Generation | Consumers | Rebuild / Correction | Failure Handling | Confirm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

If the PRD says "系统生成 / 自动生成 / 自动统计 / 自动同步", it must name the trigger, inputs, rule, persisted result, and what happens when inputs later change.

## Linkage Map

Use this table for every high-impact action:

| Action / Event | Primary Object | Linked Object / Module | Linkage Type | Change / Side Effect | Trigger Timing | Reverse / Rollback | User Visibility | Risk | Confirm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Common linkage types:

- Object linkage: create/update/void/rebuild another object.
- State linkage: one object's state changes another object's status, visibility, or selectable scope.
- Data linkage: copied fields, aggregated amounts, snapshots, source-detail occupation.
- Amount/ledger linkage: balance, frozen amount, payable/receivable, invoice amount, settlement amount.
- Permission/visibility linkage: disabled data still visible historically, selectable scope changes, role-specific buttons.
- Page linkage: jump parameters, default filters, detail entry, empty target behavior.
- Notification/task linkage: message, to-do, approval task, exception task.
- Report/statistic linkage: counters, success rate, amount totals, dashboard metrics.
- External linkage: push, callback, sync, retry, dedupe, timeout.
- Audit/log linkage: operation record, before/after value, reason, operator, time.

## Payment Completion Side-Effect Gate

Payment success is often a business event, not only a payment status change. When a payment order comes from another business module, define the attached actions that run after payment completion and the failure behavior when those actions cannot finish.

Use this gate for finance and non-finance flows where a completion event unlocks downstream work: supplier payment completion, payroll payment, refund completion, subscription payment, booking deposit, inventory purchase, membership renewal, ad spend recharge, or any external payment/callback.

| Item | Must Define |
|---|---|
| Payment source | original business object, payment order, channel callback, auto-completed adjustment, or manual confirmation |
| Completion event | paid, partially paid, failed, refunded, voided, red-flushed, or callback confirmed |
| Attached actions | source object status writeback, supplier payroll detail output, invoice/write-off update, balance release, allocation creation, message, external push, report/statistic update |
| Idempotency | stable key for payment callback and each attached action; repeated callbacks must not repeat money, files, or pushes |
| Retry | which attached actions can retry, retry trigger, retry limit, manual retry entry, and what stays pending |
| Partial failure | whether payment stays completed while side effect is pending/failed, or whether compensation is required |
| Visibility | where users see payment result, attached action result, failure reason, and recovery button |
| Reverse | refund, cancel, void, red flush, or compensation effect on already completed attached actions |

Do not hide this under "after payment, linkage is handled automatically." The PRD must say what is linked, when it runs, how it is retried, and how operators recover it.

## Post-Event Writeback Gate

Use this whenever a transaction completion, approval, payment, refund, settlement, issuance, sync, import, cancellation, or external callback changes existing objects after the main record is created. Creating downstream records is not enough; the PRD must also list every existing field that is written back because those fields often drive the next business decision.

Build a writeback inventory:

| Item | Must Define |
|---|---|
| Source event | transaction completion, payment success, audit pass, refund success, batch created, external callback, sync completed, void/red flush, or manual correction |
| Source event timestamp | the authoritative event time used for writeback, display, period attribution, retry, and audit |
| Target object | original business object, related master data, account/ledger, contractor/driver/supplier/customer profile, summary/statistic record, source detail, report cache, or external system |
| Exact persisted field | field name in business language, previous value, new value, default/null behavior, and whether it is list/detail/search/export visible |
| Business period | if writing a month/period field, define which business period it represents and which event/date anchors it |
| Writeback policy | overwrite, keep max/latest, append, accumulate, clear, recompute, version, or block after lock |
| Consumer | which later page, eligibility rule, duplicate check, filter, statistic, settlement, or external push reads the field |
| Idempotency/concurrency | stable key, duplicate callback behavior, race handling, and whether repeated completion changes the field again |
| Reverse/correction behavior | refund, void, red flush, cancellation, correction, or re-sync effect; whether to rollback, recompute, preserve history, or create an adjustment |
| Visibility/recovery | where users can see the writeback result, failure reason, retry/rebuild entry, and audit history |

Example: after labor fee payment succeeds, it may create a value-added payroll batch, but that is not enough. If the business says payment success also updates last labor payment time and labor payment month on the contractor/driver/service relationship, the PRD must state the target object, exact persisted field, source event timestamp, business period, writeback policy, consumer, idempotency, and reverse/correction behavior.

Red flag: the PRD lists only created downstream records such as "create batch / create payment order / generate bill", but does not list field writebacks on existing objects. That usually hides eligibility, duplicate prevention, reporting, and next-period logic.

## Progress-Control Field Loop

Use this when a page shows a field like last time, last month, last paid-through period, handled-through period, next period, progress marker, eligibility marker, last issued at, or last settled through. These fields are often not passive display fields. They are business control fields that decide which next operation is allowed, which period is created, and how duplicate work is blocked.

Do not wait for the user to name this pattern. During product discussion, infer it when the user mentions repeated work, monthly/periodic creation, "next time", "last time", "already paid/issued/settled", "avoid duplicate", "auto default", "cannot edit", or "continue from previous". Say the inferred loop out loud and ask a small set of confirmation questions with recommended defaults.

Discovery prompt shape:

- "This sounds like a repeated-period flow. I suggest using [field] as the progress-control field: the create popup reads it, defaults to [next period], locks the period, and advances it only after [true completion event]. Does that match the business?"
- "If [draft/rejected/payment failed/cancelled] happens, I recommend not advancing [field], so the same period can be retried. Confirm?"
- "If a completed record is voided or reissued, should [field] roll back, stay advanced with an adjustment, or be manually corrected?"
- "For first-time use, should the first period come from onboarding date, contract start date, first service month, or manual initialization?"

For each such field, define the loop:

| Item | Must Define |
|---|---|
| Field meaning | what business progress the field represents, and which object/relationship owns it |
| Display location | list/detail/card/statistic where users see it, including empty state before the first run |
| Reader action | which create/action flow reads it, at what moment, and under which object status |
| Default derivation | how the next value is calculated, such as next natural month after the last paid month |
| Editability | whether the default can be changed; if locked, show disabled reason and exception entry |
| Continuity rule | whether gaps, overlaps, repeated periods, or future periods are blocked or allowed by exception |
| Duplicate prevention | uniqueness key and idempotency key, usually subject + business period + source action |
| Advance event | the exact success event that writes the new value, such as payroll payment success, not only payroll sheet creation |
| Non-advance events | draft, submitted, rejected, cancelled, payment failed, payment pending, voided, or partial failure cases that must not advance the field |
| Reverse/correction | whether void, refund, reissue, red flush, manual correction, or data rebuild rolls back, preserves, or recomputes the progress field |
| Recovery visibility | where operators see wrong progress, retry writeback, rebuild, or manually correct with audit |

Example: the driver list shows "last payroll paid time/month". When finance creates a payroll sheet, the popup reads that field and defaults the payroll period to the next natural month; the period is locked to prevent repeated payroll creation. The field is advanced only after payroll payment succeeds and downstream payroll distribution finishes if that is the true business completion point. Draft, approval rejection, cancelled payroll sheet, payment failure, or payment-in-progress must not advance it. Void/reissue must define whether the progress rolls back or remains with an adjustment record.

Red flag: a PRD says "create payroll sheet defaults to next month" or "prevent repeated payroll" but does not define the source progress field, locked period, uniqueness key, success event that advances the field, and failure/reversal behavior. That is an incomplete flow even if the page fields look complete.

## Good-Enough Example

For a repeated payroll flow:

```text
Driver list shows last paid month from the driver payroll relationship.
Create payroll reads last paid month and defaults the period to the next natural month; the period is locked.
Payroll payment success writes back last paid month and last paid time. Draft, rejection, cancellation, payment failure, and payment-in-progress do not advance it.
Void/reissue keeps the historical value and creates an adjustment unless the platform admin uses a correction action with audit reason.
```

This is enough because it names the source field, reader action, default derivation, success writeback, non-advance events, correction behavior, and user-visible location.

## Reverse Linkage

Every cancel, reject, refund, red flush, void, rollback, rebuild, disable, or re-sync must define:

| Reverse Action | Reverted Object | Released Lock / Occupation | Reverted Data | Recomputed Data | Not Reverted | Reason / Audit | Confirm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

If the forward action links to another object, the reverse action must say whether the linked object is rolled back, kept, voided, or rebuilt.

## Change Impact Questions

When a rule or flow changes, ask:

- Which existing objects are affected?
- Which source data must be reselected, recalculated, or re-synced?
- Which downstream objects need rollback, refresh, or versioning?
- Which pages, filters, counts, exports, and reports change?
- Which notifications, approvals, and external pushes are triggered or cancelled?
- Which historical records must remain visible for audit?

Avoid saying "同步更新 / 自动回滚 / 联动处理" without listing the linked objects, timing, and failure behavior.
